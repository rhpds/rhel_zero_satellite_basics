Now we’ll register the hosts `+rhel1+` and `+rhel2+` to our Satellite
server. We’ll use the command line interface to generate a registration
command in this lab.

It is also possible to generate a registration command from the
Satellite WebUI but due to the limitations of DNS in this lab
environment, we’ll use the cli utility `+hammer+` to simplify the
process.

In our registration command, we’ll specify that the new host should be
added to the `+Application Servers+` host group we just created. As
well, we’ll ignore certificate errors (since we’re using a self signed
certificate) and we won’t set up Insights.

Click on the `+Satellite Server+` tab.

Copy and paste the following command into the terminal.

[source,bash]
----
hammer host-registration generate-command --hostgroup "Application Servers" --insecure 1 --setup-insights 0 --force 1
----

The output of this command is a curl command similar to this (don’t copy
paste this):

`+curl -sS --insecure 'https://satellite.lab/register?force=true&hostgroup_id=1&setup_insights=false' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0LCJpYXQiOjE2ODI2MjkyNzcsImp0aSI6ImQ1YjFkYThmYzM4OGY5ZjY0MmEyZjc0ZGFhNjRkMmZjODVmZDhiNjU1Y2E3NmM3ODEyYWQ5ZjQzNWE0NWE5Y2UiLCJleHAiOjE2ODI2NDM2NzcsInNjb3BlIjoicmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uI2dsb2JhbCByZWdpc3RyYXRpb24jaG9zdCJ9.bgS1XqSYd4bsY46Suq7QqC5OSKm3bSsN57c3lddiOkU' | bash+`

Copy the output by highlighting the selected text. Once the primary
click mouse, button is released, the text will be automatically saved to
the clipboard.

Now click on the `+rhel1+` tab.

Right click and select paste to paste the command into the terminal.
Finally type enter to execute the registration command.

When your host is registered, the output will resemble something similar
below.

Register `+rhel2+` with the Satellite server by pasting the registration
command into the CLI of `+rhel2+`.

In the Satellite Web UI, navigate to `+All Hosts+` to view the newly
registered host.

You can check that your host repos are configured for the Satellite
server `+satellite.lab+` by entering the following:

[source,bash]
----
cat /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo
----
