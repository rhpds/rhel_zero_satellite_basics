In this section, we’ll synchronize Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 BaseOS and
AppStream repositories from the content delivery network.

== Synchronize repositories

Navigate to the Red Hat Repositories menu by clicking on
`Red Hat Repositories` in the menu context below.

The Red Hat Repositories menu will provide a list of available
repositories. You can choose to synchronize whatever you want. In this
lab we’ll synchronize the `BaseOS` and `AppStream` repos for RHEL 9.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 is distributed through two main repositories:

* BaseOS
* AppStream

Both repositories are required for a basic RHEL installation, and are
available with all RHEL subscriptions.

Content in the BaseOS repository provides the core set of the underlying
OS functionality that provides the foundation for all installations.
This content is available in the RPM format and is subject to support
terms similar to those in previous releases of RHEL. For more
information, see the Scope of Coverage Details document.

Content in the AppStream repository includes additional user-space
applications, runtime languages, and databases in support of the varied
workloads and use cases.

Note: In order to save time, the BaseOS and AppStream repositories have
been enabled.

== Select repositories

Click on the `Recommended Repositories` button to create a more succinct
view of available repos (the image below displays the button in the off
position; turn it on).
